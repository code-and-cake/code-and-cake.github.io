Abstract:
Classes and objects are powerful concepts that are supported by most major programming languages. They make it easier to make software modular (another powerful concept in software development), and to rethink algorithms in terms of high-level interacting components rather than low-level variables and operations. Mastering these concepts does however require some effort, and that means that object-oriented programming is not used as often in science as it could be.
In this talk, I will give a very basic introduction to the concept of object-oriented programming, using a very simple example. I will focus on what classes and objects are, and why using them can improve the quality of your code. I will conclude my talk by showing object-oriented programming in action in my own code [CMacIonize](https://github.com/bwvdnbro/CMacIonize) on the code documentation ([web page](http://www-star.st-and.ac.uk/~bv7/CMacIonize_documentation/); this page was automatically generated from the source code by a tool called [doxygen](www.doxygen.org)).
