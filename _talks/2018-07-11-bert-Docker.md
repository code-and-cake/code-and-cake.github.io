An introduction to Docker
 
Modern applications have to run on a vast number of different systems, 
with different hardware (e.g. a phone vs an HPC system) and very 
different software versions (e.g. Windows XP vs Android Oreo). Making 
sure the software you want to use runs on the machine you want to use 
can hence be very difficult.
Docker is a very popular software tool that helps to address this issue. 
It is the most well-known implementation of so-called container 
technology. This technology allows you to (a) run different isolated 
software environments on the same machine, and (b) create consistent and 
portable software environments that can be run on different machines.
In this talk, I will give a very brief introduction to the concept of 
containers and why they are useful. I will then give an overview of the 
most important commands you need to set up your own containers using 
Docker.
The talk will contain a short tutorial; those who want can have a look 
at the installation instructions for Docker on 
https://docs.docker.com/install/ and follow along.
