Computers, supercomputers and how to use them. Talk covers an intro to how computers _actually_ work, and how to apply this knowledge to make your code more efficent/compatable with supercomputers.

## Useful Resources 
If you want to learn how to program in MPI, we highly advise the free summer school run by the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (epcc).
There are 2 courses that run over a week. The [first](http://www.archer.ac.uk/training/courses/2018/07/intro-epcc/index.php) covers the same information as given by Bert in his talk but goes into more depth.
The [second](https://events.prace-ri.eu/event/734/overview) gives an introduction to programming in MPI.

Both courses are ***free*** to attend for academics/students.
***Note*** if you want to attend both courses then you have to register for both separately. Alternatively you can attend just one of the courses.
