Do you worry about things like floating-point numbers in your code? Or are you like me and just bury your head in the sand and hope everything is okay? Should I just increase everything to double precision and hope that works?! Why does 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000004 ?!
This talk aims to cover the basics of what I think every computational physicist should know including floating-point numbers, random number generators, Monte Carlo method, finite difference method, and bounding hierarchy volumes.
